                        Windows command prompt is a great tool for the people who love command interface rather than Graphical UI. There are a lot of features which are still not implemented in Graphical User Interface can be accessed via CMD. In my previous articles, I’ve talked about a lot of CMD commands. In this article, I am going to share how to find out the password of all connected devices using CMD along with suitable screenshots for clear understanding.

                        Programming is one of the most important skills of a hacker. When someone wants to become a hacker, he/she has to be a good programmer. Although, It is very important to have basic knowledge of every programming language still you have to master in a particular language. For that purpose, Python is the most popular programming language among hackers. When you start learning the core of hacking, Python is great. With a giant standard library and a packaging system that puts prebuilt tools and frameworks at your fingertips, it is often very easy to hack something into existence.

This is how they do it...

                        If you compare the performance of iPhone 7 (2GB RAM) with Google Pixel  (4GB RAM) or Samsung s7 (4GB RAM), You’ll see no difference in performance. iPhone 6 was the best performing phone in its time with just 1 GB of RAM. Now, the question is why does the iPhone require less RAM than Android devices? Why does the Android device need more RAM? It involves many factors like the Garbage collection, App Management, User Interface, and Hardware.

                        Maybe you have heard about these job titles in the past, but what exactly is the difference between them? Some people claim that it mostly depends on your education and on what you have achieved; in some way, this may be true, but some others claim that sometimes the company you are working for decides if you are a programmer, a developer or other, making it merely a job title. Let’s take a closer look to this. Understanding the differences between a Coder, a Programmer, a Developer and a Software Engineer is seeing them as a hierarchy or as stair, where the Coder can be found in the low section of the stair and the Software Engineer can be found at the top. Maybe to you all these job tittles may mean the same because you once knew a Developer that could do everything a Software Engineer can, but there are really some differences between them are worth knowing.

                        What’s the difference between a degree in computer science and a degree in information technology? To the layperson, computer science and information technology may seem like the same thing. In actuality, three fields are typically associated with the study of computers at the college level. Computer engineering, information technology and computer science are all disciplines within the same realm of study. However, each specialty focuses on specific aspects of the field, and careers within the three areas vary greatly.

                        There are many things to consider when buying a new Computer. We look for RAM size, Processor, CPU, GPU, Hard Disk and display etc. But when it comes to select a Processor’s category, we prefer 64-bit Processor. In fact, Most people want 64-bit Processor PC without even knowing what does it mean to have 64-bit Processor and What is the Difference between 32-Bit and 64-Bit Processors?
